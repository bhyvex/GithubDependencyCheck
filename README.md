# GithubDependencyCheck
Automatically Run [DependencyCheck](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) Against Your Orgs Node and Ruby GitHub Repos.

## Usage:

`./GithubDependencyCheck OrgNameToScan`

Example:
`./GithubDependencyCheck netflix`
## Notes.
You will need to add your GitHub login and access key on line 2 and 3 to have this work correctly.

Output will be written to `githubvulns.csv`

I wrote a blog about it [Here](https://wp.me/p6Tvfz-F0).


## Warning.
This is an early beta. It might not work right, at all or it might break everything.
